                        JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It
                        is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for
                        example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
                        its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date,
                        and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control
                        structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a
                        variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for
                        example:
                    </p>
                    <br><br><br>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
                            to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example,
                            client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an
                            HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input,
                            and page navigation.
                        </li><br>
                        <li>
                            Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
                            relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side
                            extensions allow an application to communicate with a database,
                            provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of
                            the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.

            <p>
                JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different
                in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have
                Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most
                Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow
                constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to
                JavaScript.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
                declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
                number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.
                JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common
                class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic
                inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects.
                JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative
                requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as
                loosely typed methods.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not
                have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to
                be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and
                you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and
                function return types are not explicitly typed.
