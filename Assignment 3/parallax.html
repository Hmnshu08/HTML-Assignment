        Tropical rainforests occur in places with a tropical climate where there is no dry season. Hot and humid weather
        with high rainfall throughout the year characterize such climate. True rainforests are found up to 10 degrees of
        latitude on either side of the equator. Tropical rainforests have the greatest biodiversity of all other
        ecosystems on the planet as both sunshine and water are available in plenty in such forests. However, due to the
        dense growth of plants, there is fierce competition for survival in such habitats. As such, plants growing here
        have special adaptations that allow them to grow and thrive in the tropical rainforest. These specializations
        have been mentioned below.

        Most rainforests are structured in four layers: emergent, canopy, understory, and forest floor. Each layer has
        unique characteristics based on differing levels of water, sunlight, and air circulation. While each layer is
        distinct, they exist in an interdependent system: processes and species in one layer influence those in another.
